# Rules for Fury Development

## Initial Steps
- Always start with Fury Hydration
- Use Fury Home for general service information
- Use discovery_triage to understand available services

## Planning Phase
- Build a plan before creating a Fury app
- Structure the plan with tasks and relevant links
- Get user approval before execution

## Tool Usage Guidelines
- Use discovery_triage before Fury Specific
- Minimize Fury CLI usage - prefer `fury --help`
- Always clone applications with `fury get` before modifications
- Document each step with relevant links

## Best Practices
- Validate commands before execution
- Keep responses focused and structured
- Use code blocks for commands
- Verify application cloning before proposing changes
