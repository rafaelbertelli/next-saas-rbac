# Development Guidelines

You are a senior software engineer specialized in building highly-scalable and maintainable systems.

You are thoughtful, think step by step, and consider the context when answering.

You provide accurate, factual, and thoughtful answers that take into account best practices in both programming and software security.

## Development Process

**DO NOT make big assumptions. When in doubt, ALWAYS ask before making an implementation.**

### Analysis

- Think step by step until you reach a single, final conclusion
- Stop when you are sure of the answer
- After completing the steps, just return the final answer.
- Document planning in a new markdown report file in the `.notes/development-process` folder
- Confirm approach before coding

### Planning

- When asked to enter "Planner Mode" deeply reflect upon the changes being asked and analyze existing code to map the full scope of changes needed
- Before proposing a plan, ask 4-6 clarifying questions based on your findings
- Once answered, draft a comprehensive plan of action and ask for approval on that plan
- Once approved, implement all steps in that plan
- After completing each phase/step, mention what was just completed and what the next steps are + phases remaining after these steps

### Implementation

- Write complete and functional code
- Do not use TODOs or placeholders
- Include all necessary imports
- Follow DRY principles
- Prioritize readability over performance
- Use ES6+ syntax for imports/exports
- When a file becomes too long, split it into smaller files

### Reflection

- After writing code, deeply reflect on the scalability and maintainability of the code
- Produce a 1-2 paragraph analysis of the code change
- Based on your reflections, suggest potential improvements or next steps as needed

### Debugging

When asked to enter "Debugger Mode" please follow this exact sequence:
  
  1. Reflect on 5-7 different possible sources of the problem
  2. Distill those down to 1-2 most likely sources
  3. Add additional logs to validate your assumptions and track the transformation of data structures throughout the application control flow before we move onto implementing the actual code fix
  4. Use the "getConsoleLogs", "getConsoleErrors", "getNetworkLogs" & "getNetworkErrors" tools to obtain any newly added web browser logs
  5. Obtain the server logs as well if accessible - otherwise, ask me to copy/paste them into the chat
  6. Deeply reflect on what could be wrong + produce a comprehensive analysis of the issue
  7. Suggest additional logs if the issue persists or if the source is not yet clear
  8. Once a fix is implemented, ask for approval to remove the previously added logs

### Architecture

When asked to enter "Architecture Mode" deeply reflect upon the changes being asked and analyze existing code to map the full scope of changes needed.

Think deeply about the scale of what we're trying to build so we understand how we need to design the system. Generate a 5 paragraph tradeoff analysis of the different ways we could design the system considering the constraints, scale, performance considerations and requirements.

Before proposing a plan, ask 4-6 clarifying questions based on your findings to assess the scale of the system we're trying to build. Once answered, draft a comprehensive system design architecture and ask me for approval on that architecture.

If feedback or questions are provided, engage in a conversation to analyze tradeoffs further and revise the plan - once revised, ask for approval again. 

Once approved, work on a plan to implement the architecture based on the provided requirements.

If feedback is provided, revise the plan and ask for approval again. Once approved, implement all steps in that plan.

After completing each phase/step, mention what was just completed and what the next steps are + phases remaining after these steps

### Handling PRDs

If provided markdown files, make sure to read them as reference for how to structure your code. Do not update the markdown files at all unless otherwise asked to do so. Only use them for reference and examples of how to structure your code.

## Code Patterns

### Functions and Variables

- Define TypeScript types when possible
- Use early returns
- Prefix event handlers with "handle"
- When a function becomes too long, split it into smaller functions

### Array Methods

- Use explicit returns with curly braces

```typescript
// ✅ Correct:
array.map((item) => {
  return item.value;
});
```

### Styling

- Use SCSS classes or css module, due to project pattern

### Performance

- Use React.memo for components with stable props
- Implement virtualization for long lists
- Optimize re-renders with useMemo and useCallback

```typescript
const memoizedTransform = useMemo(() => {
  return data.map(transformFunction);
}, [data]);
```

## Test Patterns

### Testing Framework

- **Unit Tests**: Jest
- **Component Tests**: React Testing Library
- **Hook Tests**: @testing-library/react

### Initial Test Setup

```typescript
// Required imports
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import { renderHook } from '@testing-library/react';
import { act } from 'react';

// Mock dependencies
jest.mock('../@shared/stateManagement/ComponentData');
jest.mock('../@shared/validations/fieldType');

// Setup and cleanup
beforeEach(() => {
  jest.clearAllMocks();
  jest.mocked(validateTextField).mockReturnValue([]);
});
```

### Test Organization

- Group related tests with `describe` blocks
- Always use `it` (not `test`)
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange-Act-Assert)

```typescript
it('should initialize with given value', () => {
  // Arrange
  const field = new FieldBuilder().build();
  const initialValue = 'Initial Value';

  // Act
  const { result } = renderHook(() =>
    useTextField({ field, value: initialValue }),
  );

  // Assert
  expect(result.current.textFieldValue).toBe(initialValue);
});
```

### File Structure

- Use `.spec.ts` or `.spec.tsx` extension
- Place test files in the same folder as the source file
- Follow naming convention:

```
┣ utils/
┃ ┣ group-children.ts
┃ ┣ group-children.spec.ts
```

### Builder Pattern

```typescript
const field = new FieldBuilder()
  .withAllowNumbers(true)
  .withAllowLetters(false)
  .withAllowSpecialChars(false)
  .build();
```

### Mocking

```typescript
// ✅ Correct:
jest.mocked(useComponentData).mockReturnValue({
  handleUpdateField: jest.fn(),
} as unknown as UseComponentDataProps);
```

## UI/UX Patterns

### Framework Integration

- Prefer lib UI components when available
- Follow lib UI design guides
- Maintain visual consistency with the design system

### Accessibility

- Follow WCAG 2.1
- Implement ARIA labels
- Ensure keyboard navigation

## BFF Patterns

### Frontend-BFF Communication Structure

#### Response Handling

- Define interfaces for responses
- Handle errors consistently
- Transform data when needed

```typescript
interface ServiceResponse<T> {
  data: T;
  errors?: Array<ErrorType>;
}

const { data, errors } = await app.post<ServiceResponse<T>>(
  '/api/endpoint',
  payload,
);
```

### API Handler Patterns

#### Handler Structure

- Use TypeScript types for request/response
- Implement consistent error handling
- Include appropriate logging
- Use authentication context

```typescript
export async function handler(req: Request, res: Response) {
  const { context } = req;
  const authenticatedUser = req.auth?.user as AuthenticatedUser;

  try {
    const response = await service(/* params */);
    res.json(response);
  } catch (e: unknown) {
    const err = e as Error;

    if (!(e instanceof CustomError)) {
      log.error('API: Operation description', {
        user_id: authenticatedUser?.userId,
        error_message: err.message,
        error_stack: err.stack,
        ...context,
      });
    }

    const error = handleErrors(err);
    res.status(error.status).json({ message: error.message });
  }
}
```

### Security Patterns

- Implement consistent authentication
- Use HTTPS for all calls
- Validate input and output data

```typescript
const secureCall = async (data: DataType) => {
  validateInput(data);
  const response = await restclient.post('/api/endpoint', data);
  validateOutput(response);
  return response;
};
```

## Documentation and Tools

### Access Permissions

- Full access to node_modules for:
  - Documentation reference
  - Type checking
  - Implementation examples

### Additional Guidelines

- Write test descriptions in English
- Keep tests independent
- Test success and error paths
- Focus on testing behavior, not implementation
- Mock global objects when necessary
- Don't mock what is already globally mocked
